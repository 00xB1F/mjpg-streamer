mjpg-streamer
=============

This is a fork of http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpg-streamer/

mjpg-streamer is a command line application that copies JPEG frames from one
or more input plugins to multiple output plugins. It can be used to stream
JPEG files over an IP-based network from a webcam to various types of viewers
such as Chrome, Firefox, Cambozola, VLC, mplayer, and other software capable
of receiving MJPG streams.

It was originally written for embedded devices with very limited resources in
terms of RAM and CPU. Its predecessor "uvc_streamer" was created because
Linux-UVC compatible cameras directly produce JPEG-data, allowing fast and
perfomant M-JPEG streams even from an embedded device running OpenWRT. The
input module "input_uvc.so" captures such JPG frames from a connected webcam.
mjpg-streamer now supports a variety of different input devices.

Security warning
----------------

**WARNING**: mjpg-streamer should not be used on untrusted networks!

At this time, none of the output plugins implement any kind of access controls
or encryption. Anyone with access to the network that mjpg-streamer is running
on will be able to access it.

Plugins
-------

Input plugins:

* input_file
* input_http
* input_ptp2
* input_raspicam ([documentation](mjpg-streamer-experimental/plugins/input_raspicam/README.md))
* input_uvc ([documentation](mjpg-streamer-experimental/plugins/input_uvc/README.md))

Output plugins:

* output_file
* output_http ([documentation](mjpg-streamer-experimental/plugins/output_http/README.md))
* output_rtsp
* output_udp
* output_viewer ([documentation](mjpg-streamer-experimental/plugins/output_viewer/README.md))

Building & Installation
=======================

You must have cmake installed. You will also probably want to have a development
version of libjpeg installed. I used libjpeg62-dev.

Simple compilation
------------------

This will build and install all plugins that can be compiled.

    cd mjpg-streamer-experimental
    make
    sudo make install
    
Advanced compilation (via CMake)
--------------------------------

There are options available to enable/disable plugins, setup options, etc. This
shows the basic steps.

    cd mjpg-streamer-experimental
    mkdir _build
    cd _build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

Usage
=====

See [README.md](mjpg-streamer-experimental/README.md) for more details.
